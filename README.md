Social ID
========

My first medium-sized Django project. Social ID was a service aimed at providing people a way to gather under one ID all of their online presence, comparable to a passport number o social security number for the internet.

Working with facebook connect and Postgres was a nice experience, however after a year being live, the project never became self-sustainable and I shut it down.


DISCLAIMER: Some of this code was just meant to work and is not pretty at all.
